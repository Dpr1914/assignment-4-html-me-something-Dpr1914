               <p>As you can see I have worked in the hospitality industry in some fashion for most of my career.  I thing the reason why I stayed on this path for so long was my desire to own my own restaurant one day.  I learned my on job work ethic from my first job at Dominoes Pizza located at 7240 Natural Bridge Rd, Normandy, MO 63121<br></p>

               <p>I could see a clear picture for my career path as bright as day.  However, there was an emptiness that I couldn't fill throughout jobs 3-7. Through typical office politics and nepotism I lost my desire to continue on the path I was on, and then Job 8(EDC) was dropped in my lap.</p>

               <p>I literally opened my email one day from a hiring agency ask me to come in, I don't remember applying.  This has to be best job I ever had, although, I can't but feel that I need to do something more.....<br></p>

               <h2><b>Best Trip Ever</b></h2>
                  <p>Its 1992, 12 year old me has had a long year.  From getting knocked unconsious while playing kickball to experiencing and dealing with the death of my mother, needless to say I needed a win and quickly before I shut down.  Fortunately, my best friends family had the answer at the time, a 7-day Caribbean Islands' cruise.  My vehichle on this journey was named the <em>Carnival Ship Sensation</em>.  There were a lot of firsts that happend to me on that ship and around those Island's.  The 7 islands visited were:<br></p>

               <h2><b>He's A Natural</b></h2>
               <p>Two things always came natural to me: drawing and math.  Math has always been my second language as long I've known.  However, drawing has always been my first love as a hobby.  I can't remember when exactly the attraction came from, but by 3rd grade I was placing in art contesst without even trying with my drawing of Dr.Martin Luther King Jr.</p>

               <p>From drawings, to paintings, to tattoos, I've evolved as an artist.  At one point I considered a career in tattoing, but now, I just like it as a side hustle/hobbie</p>
